@text excise taxes lower real incomes in proportion to each tax unitâ€™s share of labor income plus the portion of capital income that exceeds the normal rate of return. In addition, we assume that excise taxes paid or passed through to the retail level change the relative prices consumers face (i.e., raise the cost of taxed goods and services relative to others).
