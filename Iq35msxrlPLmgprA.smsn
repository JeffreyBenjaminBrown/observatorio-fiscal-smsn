The incidence of the corporate tax, however, is an unsettled theoretical issue. The tax could be borne by the owners of corporate stock, or passed on in part to labor in the form of lower real wages, to consumers in the form of higher prices, or to the owners of some or all capital in the form of lower real rates of return.

In September 2012, we updated the assumptions we use to distribute the corporate income tax: we now estimate that 60 percent is borne by shareholders, 20 percent by all capital owners, and 20 percent by labor.
