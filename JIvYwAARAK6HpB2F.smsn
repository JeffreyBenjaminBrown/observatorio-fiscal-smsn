@title irrelevant for now : disallow subsampling of coicop data set in enph-2017

Irrelevant because we don't use the coicop.csv data set from the ENPH.
  We use a different coicop data set, data/vat/coicop-vat.csv, which never gets subsampled.

One solution: Code the subsamples of COICOP all to be the full COICOP data setN
